    " Overfitting and underfitting are two common problems in machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, to the point where it starts memorizing the noise or random fluctuations in the data instead of capturing the underlying patterns. As a result, the model performs well on the training data but fails to generalize well on new, unseen data. The consequences of overfitting include poor performance on test data, high variance, and a lack of ability to make accurate predictions on real-world examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Underfitting, on the other hand, happens when a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data. It occurs when the model fails to learn the relevant relationships between the input features and the target variable. An underfit model may have high bias and low variance, leading to poor performance both on the training and test data. It typically exhibits a high error rate and fails to capture the complexities present in the data."

    "Regularization: This technique adds a penalty term to the model's loss function, discouraging complex or large parameter values. Regularization helps to control overfitting by limiting the model's flexibility.\n",

It quantifies the model's tendency to make assumptions or oversimplify the underlying patterns in the data.

Such a model tends to overfit and performs well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data.\n",

As we reduce the bias of a model (by increasing its complexity or flexibility), we tend to increase its variance, and vice versa. The challenge is to strike the right balance between bias and variance to achieve optimal performance. The goal is to find the sweet spot where the model is complex enough to capture the relevant patterns in the data but not so complex that it starts memorizing noise or random fluctuations."

    "Regularization is a technique in machine learning used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the model's objective function or loss function. This penalty discourages the model from becoming too complex or having large parameter values, promoting simpler and more generalizable models.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several common regularization techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "L1 Regularization (Lasso): L1 regularization adds the sum of the absolute values of the model's coefficients as the penalty term. It encourages sparsity in the model, meaning it promotes some coefficients to become exactly zero. This helps in feature selection by automatically identifying and excluding irrelevant features from the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "L2 Regularization (Ridge): L2 regularization adds the sum of the squared values of the model's coefficients as the penalty term. It encourages small but non-zero values for all coefficients. L2 regularization shrinks the coefficients towards zero without eliminating them entirely, leading to a more stable model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net Regularization: Elastic Net regularization combines L1 and L2 regularization by adding both penalty terms to the model's loss function. It aims to strike a balance between the sparsity-inducing L1 regularization and the coefficient shrinkage of L2 regularization. The Elastic Net penalty term has two hyperparameters controlling the balance between L1 and L2 regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dropout: Dropout is a regularization technique commonly used in neural networks. During training, dropout randomly sets a fraction of the neurons' outputs to zero at each training step, effectively \"dropping out\" those neurons. This prevents the network from relying too heavily on any particular subset of neurons and encourages more robust and generalizable representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Early Stopping: Early stopping is not a traditional regularization technique, but it effectively prevents overfitting. It involves monitoring the model's performance on a validation set during training and stopping the training process when the validation performance starts to degrade. Early stopping helps prevent the model from continuing to train and overfit the data."
